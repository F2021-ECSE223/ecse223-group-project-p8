Small note from mike:

To get to git in eclipse, right click and go to teams.

 - Adding stuff to the repo is Commit and Push
 - Updating the local files to what is in the repo is Pull
 - Rebase means undo all the changes you made and the files will be previous commit
 
If you are ever asked to login with git, the username is what you have on git and your password needs to be taken from the developer page in settings. It's called an authentication token, this is the password.
